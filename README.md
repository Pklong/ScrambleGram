A mad dash to unscramble the word with only 5 seconds to spare. Each
correct answer resets the clock, but longer words await...

are revealed below. Click the scrambled version of the target word from
among the decoys before the timer hits zero.

##Technical Features
- Mobile-first responsive design.
- Background dynamically colors based on time-remaining.
- Object oriented programming in JavaScript.
- Instance variables track game state to prevent erroneous input.
